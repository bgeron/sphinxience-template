# Minimal Makefile that defers to Makefile in the parent directory. Symlink
# this from subdirectories for your convenience: cd into a subdirectory, and run
#
#     ln -s ../subMakefile Makefile
# 
# or from a deeper subdirectory:
#
#     ln -s ../../subMakefile Makefile
#
# et cetera.

.PHONY: Makefile
